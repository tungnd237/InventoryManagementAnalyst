## [2] 4/7 FRI 1500
### 1. Data source = [Superstore](https://www.kaggle.com/code/seifmohmed/end-to-end-data-science-project-part-1-analysis)
	reasoning:
	1) optimal inventory levels inferrable
	2) consumer-specific data (not in UCI) 
	3) data is almost in raw form

### 2. Preprocessing
- check for anomalities in dataset

### 3. Clustering

	actual implications of clustering?
> can we identify cluster with high level of profit performance?

	assumption: certain products are of high popularity
- -> drop unrelated variables and start with important variables

### 4. Validation and Interpretation of Results
	1. improve performance of classification
	2. find meaningful interpretation/approach for each cluster

## [1] 4/4 TUE after class
### 1. basic approach = grouping products based on the demands

### 2. Objective
	1. Identify groups of products with similar demand patterns
	2. Identify optimal inventory levels for each cluster
### 3. Performance metrics
	1. inventory carrying costs 
	2. product availability
	3. order fullfillment speed
