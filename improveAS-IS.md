### Utilization of Clusters to Improve the AS-IS Model

The AS-IS model signifies the existing process of inventory management, potentially relying on methods such as first-in-first-out (FIFO), last-in-first-out (LIFO), or a simple reorder threshold. Although these methods can be straightforward to implement, they often overlook the variability in demand and profitability among different product categories.

Utilizing clusters that incorporate data including sales, quantity sold, discount amount, profit, and product category enables the development of a nuanced inventory management strategy. This could encompass setting differentiated reorder points for products within distinct clusters, pricing products in alignment with their demand and profit profiles, and leveraging high-volume products to negotiate better supplier contracts.

### AS-IS Model: Pros and Cons

The AS-IS model refers to the current state of the inventory management process.

Pros:
Simplicity and ease of implementation.
Adequate for businesses with limited product diversity.
Cons:
Does not consider variability among products in terms of sales, quantity sold, discount amount, profit, and category.
Potential for overstocking or understocking, missed sales opportunities, and suboptimal profitability.

###Domain Knowledge - Statistical Methods in Inventory Management

Modern inventory management companies increasingly utilize data analytics and machine learning for optimization. These techniques include:

Time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, state space models, LSTM neural networks) for future sales prediction.
ABC analysis for product prioritization based on value.
Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) models for minimizing total inventory costs.
Safety stock calculations as a buffer against variability in demand and lead time.
Multivariate clustering, such as K-means analysis, for comprehensive understanding of relationships among various product attributes.
### Comparison of AS-IS Based Clustering and New Clustering Methods

A comparative analysis of the AS-IS method and the new clustering methods reveals significant benefits:

Detail-oriented: Clustering offers a granular view of product assortment, in contrast to the AS-IS approach which might not differentiate among products.
Adaptive: Clustering can adapt to changes in product performance, with clusters being recalculable with new sales data. The AS-IS method may lack such flexibility.
Profit-focused: The new clustering methods incorporate data on discount amount and profit. This allows inventory management to focus on not just sales volume, but also profitability.
